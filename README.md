# Soundcloud-ID-Scraper
Minimalistic and simple tool for quickly grabbing user IDs of desired soundclouds. Useful for checking usernames of users or keeping up to date through name changes/activity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supports (and is recommended) using multiple accounts to avoid rate limit. The more IDs you need, the more accounts you should have to use. (Proxy support could also easily be implemented to further prevent limits (Not in current tool)).
Utilizes Souncloud OAuth tokens to make requests. 

auths.txt -> OAuth tokens 

usernames.txt -> Soundcloud usernames that you wish to check IDs for 

validsouncclouds.json -> stores results of IDs for users
